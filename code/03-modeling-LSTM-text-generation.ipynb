          work from roberta\\'s class: a collection of eccentric abstract \\n\\n               bric-a-brac and enid\\'s large painting. the painting has drawn \\n\\n               a small crowd. we see a chain of events beginning with three \\n\\n               parents talking to a matronly director/curator who in turn \\n\\n               seeks out roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for \\n\\n               the first time).\\n\\n                                     director\\n\\n                         i\\'m afraid you\\'re simply going to \\n\\n                         have to take that painting down.  \\n\\n                         several of the parents have \\n\\n                         complained.\\n\\n                                     roberta\\n\\n

myself!\\n\\n               she marches towards it. roberta runs after her.\\n\\n                                     roberta\\n\\n                         i think we should give the artist a \\n\\n                         chance to talk to the parents about \\n\\n                         her intentions with this piece...  \\n\\n                         we should be promoting discussion as \\n\\n

a box that she doesn\\'t recognize. inside \\n\\n               are her old children\\'s records (45\\'s). she excitedly takes \\n\\n               one out and plays it. she folds her clothes while listening \\n\\n               to this song, which clearly is getting to her. she grabs \\n\\n               mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. it\\'s \\n\\n               the uniform from her job at \"computer station.\" she folds \\n\\n               it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange \\n\\n               fabric.\\n\\n               int. enid and

            time to 12:45. she goes to the phone and calls enid. the \\n\\n               machine picks up and rebecca hangs up. she does another \\n\\n               tedious, pointless task. it\\'s now 3:30. she\\'s pissed off and \\n\\n               goes to the phone to call again. as it rings there\\'s a knock \\n\\n               on the door. relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.\\n\\n

chips. then he tries to flip over a big display case in front \\n\\n               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying \\n\\n               and gets more and more

hold with \\n\\n               his nunchucks. doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. josh is freaked \\n\\n               out. seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.\\n\\n               the

exasperated. she goes to look out the window. cars with loud \\n\\n               radios can be heard driving by. she goes to the phone - she \\n\\n               checks it and hangs up. pause. she picks it up again - one \\n\\n               last try. she dials the number and waits. we hear the beep \\n\\n               of the answering machine. rebecca hangs up.\\n\\n               she gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a \\n\\n               cold linoleum floor). she zips the zipper all the way over \\n\\n               her head and curls up into a whimpering

         right in front of it. she looks through the partially papered \\n\\n               over window and sees workmen inside installing new fixtures: \\n\\n               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a \\n\\n               familiar green plastic. a sign in the window reads: \"coming \\n\\n               soon: another coffee experience.\\n\\n               ext.

the same thing \\n\\n               happens in another window down the street... then another...  \\n\\n               enid looks down the street. in the distance a bus rounds the \\n\\n
