her boom box. the punk \\n\\n               rock song we heard earlier plays. she yanks out the tape and \\n\\n               flings it away. she skims through her records and cds, \\n\\n               dismissing them all. she notices seymour\\'s bag in the corner.\\n\\n               she takes out the record and puts it on. the first tune is \\n\\n               an upbeat instrumental number. she returns to the bathroom.\\n\\n               several minutes pass. track two begins on the lp. she (and \\n\\n               we) slowly begin to take notice. it\\'s a strange, haunting \\n\\n

bedroom - evening\\n\\n               seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique \"candlestick\" \\n\\n               telephone. in the background, a peter, paul and mary concert \\n\\n               plays on the tv. we hear three rings followed by enid\\'s \\n\\n               answering machine message. he hangs up before it finishes.  \\n\\n               joe walks by the doorway.\\n\\n

a box that she doesn\\'t recognize. inside \\n\\n               are her old children\\'s records (45\\'s). she excitedly takes \\n\\n               one out and plays it. she folds her clothes while listening \\n\\n               to this song, which clearly is getting to her. she grabs \\n\\n               mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. it\\'s \\n\\n               the uniform from her job at \"computer station.\" she folds \\n\\n               it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange \\n\\n               fabric.\\n\\n               int. enid and

            time to 12:45. she goes to the phone and calls enid. the \\n\\n               machine picks up and rebecca hangs up. she does another \\n\\n               tedious, pointless task. it\\'s now 3:30. she\\'s pissed off and \\n\\n               goes to the phone to call again. as it rings there\\'s a knock \\n\\n               on the door. relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.\\n\\n

chips. then he tries to flip over a big display case in front \\n\\n               of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying \\n\\n               and gets more and more

huge mess. he tries to grab seymour and they get \\n\\n               into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. seymour starts yelling.  \\n\\n               suddenly doug appears and gets seymour in a choke hold with \\n\\n               his nunchucks. doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. josh is freaked \\n\\n               out. seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.\\n\\n               the

exasperated. she goes to look out the window. cars with loud \\n\\n               radios can be heard driving by. she goes to the phone - she \\n\\n               checks it and hangs up. pause. she picks it up again - one \\n\\n               last try. she dials the number and waits. we hear the beep \\n\\n               of the answering machine. rebecca hangs up.\\n\\n               she gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a \\n\\n               cold linoleum floor). she zips the zipper all the way over \\n\\n               her head and curls up into a whimpering

twenty-somethings. we \\n\\n               see that rebecca is now a waitress here. she tears off a \\n\\n               check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted \\n\\n               european hipster, who is too busy tapping away at his \\n\\n               powerbook to notice.\\n\\n               she walks toward the end of the counter to total up her \\n\\n               receipts. she looks up and sees enid, wearing tasteful 1930\\'s \\n\\n               style clothes, sitting across from her.\\n\\n                                     enid\\n\\n

                                rebecca\\n\\n                         do you want anything?\\n\\n                                     enid\\n\\n                         maybe an orange juice.\\n\\n               rebecca goes to get it. enid looks around, bemused and \\n\\n               saddened by what the quality cafe has become.\\n\\n                                     enid\\n\\n

finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind \\n\\n               the counter. she kisses josh perfunctorily.\\n\\n                                     rebecca\\n\\n

now-alien \\n\\n               world of the quality cafe. a momentary pause as she calmly \\n\\n               stares into her orange juice. we see a small, round travel \\n\\n               bag at her feet.\\n\\n               ext. city streets/acme shoes - evening\\n\\n               we see enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.\\n\\n               it\\'s early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.\\n\\n               she walks toward the old acme shoes and repair store. it \\n\\n               looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands \\n\\n               right in front of it. she looks through the partially papered \\n\\n               over window and sees workmen inside installing new fixtures: \\n\\n               a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a \\n\\n               familiar green plastic. a sign in the window reads: \"coming \\n\\n               soon: another coffee experience.\\n\\n               ext. city street - evening\\n\\n               she continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm \\n\\n               stillness to the city. she turns a corner and is startled by \\n\\n               her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. she \\n\\n               stops and looks at herself. everything about her looks perfect \\n\\n               for once; no need to change a thing. she moves closer to the \\n\\n               glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.\\n\\n               she continues walking. darkness is just setting in and she \\n\\n               has the street all to herself.\\n\\n               ext. commercial area/bus stop - night\\n\\n               we see enid at norman\\'s bus stop, sitting on the bench. she \\n\\n               looks at the apartment building across the street. a woman \\n\\n               who has just arrived home from work turns on the tv, bathing \\n\\n               her living room with that eerie blue light. the same thing \\n\\n               happens in another window down the street... then another...  \\n\\n               enid looks down the street. in the distance a bus rounds the \\n\\n               corner and heads toward her.\\n\\n               from a third-story window across the street, we see the bus \\n\\n               as it arrives and stops, blocking enid from view. a moment \\n\\n
